# Product Context

Why this project exists
- Many educators and students need a fast way to design and share weekly course timetables. This app reduces friction and makes schedule creation visual and repeatable.

Problems it solves
- Manual timetable drawing (slow, error-prone).
- Sharing schedules across devices and printing/exporting.

How it should work
- Users add courses into a grid (days × timeslots) and can edit metadata (name, room, color).
- Changes persist locally; users can export/import JSON or export a printable format.
- Users can toggle **Dark Mode** for comfortable viewing in low light.
- Users can add a custom **Program Title** and choose whether to include it within the social-media-ready square export.

User experience goals
- Minimal onboarding: immediate edit surface on first load.
- Keyboard + mouse friendly editing, accessible color choices.
- Clear visual hierarchy and compact export output.
